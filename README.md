# React Portfolio
This application was meant to be a web developers profile, with pages for contact info, resume, and to be able to see all of the projects completed. 
## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
## Installation
